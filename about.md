### Who and What is Bitanical, LLC?

<img class="right profile" src="{{ site.url }}/images/patrick-125x125.png" width="125" height="125" alt="Patrick Ward" border="0">

Bitanical was formed to create simple, fun, and delightful software for web and mobile devices. It is currently a one-man shop piloted by me, [Patrick Ward](http://patrickward.com), a software developer, network engineer, and project manager with over 15 years of corporate and web development experience. I've spent my career crafting solutions for projects as diverse as vehicle tracking, port management, medical staff management, and ecommerce.


### Is Bitanical Available for Consulting Work?

Bitanical is focused on building simple products, so I'm not currently available for consulting work. If you would like to work with me on a custom project of yours, please contact **Denise Glass** at [Sensory 5](http://sensory5.com) where I work as the CTO and Chief Geek.
